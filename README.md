# TDDeter - Mobile app 

### About the project

One month project to develop an app as a group of four. For the frontend we chose to use React Native to be able to develop for iOS as well as Android. The challenge was to use TDD as a development method, thus it was logical for us to code in a langage we already knew : Javascript. For the backend part, we wanted our database to be accessible to all of us in the cloud ; we chose Supabase for its relational functionalities with PostgreSQL.<br>
<br>
Our main missions were : <br>
→ Development of an iOS and Android app <br>
→ Working with <b>TDD</b> methodology (Test Driven Development) <br>
&emsp; &emsp; <i>› Writing tests from a user experience point of view <br> 
&emsp; &emsp; › Testing database and API <br>
&emsp; &emsp; › Continuous integration of tests </i><br>
→ Working with Agile standards
